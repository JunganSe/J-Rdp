# J-Rdp
---



## Summary
J-Rdp is a tool to automate the editing and launching of rdp files.

It will watch one or more folders for new files, using name criteria filters.\
When a new file is found, several actions can be taken:
- Move the file to another location.
- Edit settings in the file.
- Launch the file.
- Delete the file.
<br/><br/>



## Launching
The application can be run directly as a console app, or silently in the background.\
No installation is needed.

To run it as a console app, simply open the exe file.

To run it silently, open the exe file with the argument `-HideConsole`\
A pair of bat files are provided to start it silently, and to stop it.

To run the app automatically on boot/login, use either of these methods:\
\- Create a shortcut and put it in your startup folder.\
\- Use the Windows task scheduler to launch it on login or startup.
